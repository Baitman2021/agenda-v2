# Getting Started

### Local API

For quicker dev we can just `nodemon` to quick restart the api when changes
are saved to `.js` files (after installing nodemon with `npm i -g nodemon`) with
the following:

```
npm run dev
```

Then start the container named `mongo` in docker desktop (this will not need to be restarted).
