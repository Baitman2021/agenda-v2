# Agenda

Agenda will allow for more efficient meetings by estabilshing meeting topics in advance, establishing each topics value, and then deciding on the order and allocating time to the topics based on their value. In addition, agenda will simplify meeting notes avoiding TLDR through action items for each topic.

# Running Agenda

1. Generate public and private keys and install dependencies:
```
bash scripts/setup
```
2. Run the backend in docker containers and the frontend with node:
```
bash scripts/dev
```
All output will be be seen in the terminal that the commands are run in. 
Changes in the api and frontend are listened to seperately.
